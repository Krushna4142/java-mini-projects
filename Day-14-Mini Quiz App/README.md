## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 14** is to build a **To-Do List Manager** that allows:

- Adding tasks
- Viewing all tasks
- Marking tasks as completed
- Deleting tasks

This project introduces **dynamic data storage using ArrayList**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Core Java Concepts

- ArrayList
- Class & Object
- Encapsulation
- Loops
- Menu-driven program

### Logical Skills

- CRUD operations
- Dynamic record handling
- Index-based operations

---

## 📝 What I Built

A **console-based task manager** where a user can:

✔ Add a task  
✔ View all tasks  
✔ Mark task as completed  
✔ Delete a task  
✔ Exit

📌 Dynamic storage using ArrayList  
📌 Real-world productivity application  
📌 Clean OOP structure

## ⚙️ System Logic Explained

Create a `Task` class with:

- taskName
- isCompleted

Store tasks inside an `ArrayList<Task>`.

Menu operations:

1 → Add task  
2 → View tasks  
3 → Mark task as completed  
4 → Delete task  
5 → Exit

ArrayList allows:

Dynamic growth  
Easy deletion  
Index-based updates

This simulates **real task manager behavior**.

## 📝 Notes & Observations

ArrayList removes fixed-size limitation of arrays

CRUD operations make programs real-world ready

Index handling is important in dynamic data

Encapsulation keeps task structure clean

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

This is your first **collections-based application**

Dynamic storage is essential for scalable systems

This project is similar to real productivity apps

You are now writing **resume-level Java programs**

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 14 Level)

**Q1. Why use ArrayList instead of an array?**  
Because it can grow dynamically.

**Q2. What is CRUD?**  
Create, Read, Update, Delete.

**Q3. How do you mark a task as completed?**  
By updating the object using its index.

**Q4. Why use a separate Task class?**  
To follow OOP and store structured data.
