## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 12** is to build a **Bank Account System** using **Object-Oriented Programming**.

This project focuses on:

- Designing a class
- Encapsulation
- Object creation
- Real-world simulation using Java

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Core OOP Concepts

- Class & Object
- Encapsulation
- Instance variables
- Methods
- Constructor
- Data hiding

### Logical Skills

- Real-world mapping into code
- State management
- Method-driven operations

---

## 🏦 What I Built

A **console-based bank account system** where a user can:

✔ Create an account  
✔ Deposit money  
✔ Withdraw money  
✔ Check balance

📌 Object-oriented design  
📌 Real-world scenario  
📌 Clean method-based operations

## ⚙️ System Design Explained

Create a `BankAccount` class with:

- accountHolderName
- accountNumber
- balance

Methods:

- deposit()
- withdraw()
- checkBalance()

Create object in main class and perform operations.

This demonstrates **data + behavior in a single unit (OOP core idea)**.

## 📝 Notes & Observations

OOP helps model real-world entities

Encapsulation protects account data

Methods define object behavior

State changes when deposit/withdraw is performed

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

Everything in Java revolves around objects

Encapsulation improves security

Constructor initializes object state

This is the foundation for advanced OOP

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 12 Level)

**Q1. What is encapsulation?**  
Binding data and methods into a single unit and restricting direct access.

**Q2. Why use a constructor?**  
To initialize object values at the time of creation.

**Q3. Why keep variables private?**  
To protect data from unauthorized access.

**Q4. Real-world use of this system?**  
Banking applications & financial systems.
