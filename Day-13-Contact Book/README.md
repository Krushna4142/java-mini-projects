## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 13** is to build a **Contact Book System** that can:

- Store multiple contacts
- Display all contacts
- Search a contact
- Use a menu-driven interface

This project introduces **data management using arrays**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Core Java Concepts

- Arrays of objects
- Menu-driven programs
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Class & Object

### Logical Skills

- Managing multiple records
- Searching data
- User-driven program flow

---

## 📒 What I Built

A **console-based contact book** where a user can:

✔ Add new contact  
✔ View all contacts  
✔ Search contact by name  
✔ Exit the system

📌 Stores multiple records  
📌 Real-world simulation  
📌 Structured data handling

## ⚙️ System Logic Explained

Create a `Contact` class with:

- name
- phoneNumber

Store multiple contact objects inside an array

Use a menu to:

1 → Add contact  
2 → View all contacts  
3 → Search contact  
4 → Exit

Traverse array to display and search records.

This demonstrates **record management without collections**.

## 📝 Notes & Observations

Arrays can store multiple objects

Menu-driven programs simulate real applications

Searching requires traversal

Structured storage improves clarity

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

This is your first multi-record system

Arrays act as a basic database

Object arrays are powerful

Logic becomes closer to real software

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 13 Level)

**Q1. Why use an array of objects here?**  
To store multiple contact records.

**Q2. How does searching work?**  
By traversing the array and matching names.

**Q3. What are the limitations of arrays?**  
Fixed size.

**Q4. What is the better alternative in real applications?**  
ArrayList or database.
