## 📘 Introduction

Understanding Java concepts is important, but **applying them correctly is what builds engineering skill**.

**`java-mini-projects`** exists to translate Java fundamentals into **practical, working applications**, focusing on structure, clarity, and real-world thinking rather than flashy demos.

This repository is for:
- Computer engineering students  
- Java and backend-focused learners  
- Developers building strong project foundations  

---

## 🎯 Goals & Outcomes

- Apply Java fundamentals in real scenarios  
- Strengthen OOP and design understanding  
- Practice clean, readable, maintainable code  
- Learn how small systems are structured  
- Build credible, interview-ready projects
