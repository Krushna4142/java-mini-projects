## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 03** is to build a **console-based Number Guessing Game** that helps practice:

- Loop-based execution
- Conditional decision making
- User interaction flow
- Program control using attempts

This project moves from **static logic** to **interactive logic**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Core Java Concepts

- `while` loop
- `if-else` conditions
- `break` statement
- User input using `Scanner`
- Random number generation

### Logical Skills

- Comparing user input with system-generated values
- Controlling program flow using attempts
- Providing meaningful user feedback

---

## 🎮 What I Built

I built a **Number Guessing Game** where:

- The system generates a random number
- The user tries to guess it
- The program guides the user with hints:
  - Too High
  - Too Low
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed

📌 Fully interactive  
📌 Loop-controlled execution  
📌 Beginner-friendly logic

<h2>⚙️ Game Logic Explained
Generate a random number within a fixed range</h2>

Ask the user to guess the number

Compare guess with generated number

Give hints (higher / lower)

Repeat until the user guesses correctly

End the game with a success message

This logic demonstrates real-time decision making.

<h2>📝 Notes & Observations</h2>
Loops allow programs to repeat until a condition is met

Interactive programs feel more engaging than static ones

Clear feedback improves user experience

Even simple games can demonstrate strong logic

<h2>💡 Key Takeaways</h2>
Loops are essential for interactive applications

Conditions control user flow

Random number generation adds unpredictability

Clean logic makes programs easy to extend

<h2>🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 03 Level)</h2>
Q1. Why is a loop required in this game?
To allow the user to guess multiple times until the correct number is found.

Q2. How does the program give hints to the user?
By comparing the guessed number with the generated number using conditions.

Q3. What happens if the loop is removed?
The user would get only one chance, breaking the game logic.

Q4. How can this game be improved?
By adding attempt limits, score tracking, or replay options.
