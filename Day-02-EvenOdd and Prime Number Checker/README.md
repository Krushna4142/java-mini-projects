## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 02** is to strengthen **decision-making logic** in Java by building a program that:

- Checks whether a number is **Even or Odd**
- Checks whether a number is **Prime or Not**

This project focuses on **conditions, loops, and mathematical logic**, which are essential for every Java developer.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Core Java Fundamentals

- `if-else` conditions
- `for` loop
- Modulus operator (`%`)
- Boolean flags
- User input using `Scanner`

### Logical Thinking

- Understanding number divisibility
- Optimizing prime number checks
- Writing readable conditional logic

---

## 🛠️ What I Built

I built a **console-based Java application** that:

- Accepts a number from the user
- Determines if the number is **Even or Odd**
- Determines if the number is **Prime or Not**
- Displays clear, user-friendly output

📌 Single input  
📌 Multiple logical checks  
📌 Clean separation of logic

⚙️ Program Logic Breakdown
Even / Odd Check
A number is Even if it is divisible by 2

Otherwise, it is Odd

Prime Number Check
Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime

Check divisibility from 2 to n-1

If divisible by any number → Not Prime

Otherwise → Prime

This approach keeps the logic simple and beginner-friendly.

📝 Notes & Observations
Conditional logic becomes easier with clear problem breakdown

Prime number checking improves loop understanding

Small programs like this build strong confidence

Writing readable conditions matters more than clever tricks

💡 Key Takeaways
Mastering basics avoids future logical bugs

Even simple programs can be interview-relevant

Clean logic > complex code

Conditions and loops are the backbone of Java

🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 02 Level)
Q1. How do you check if a number is even or odd in Java?
Using the modulus operator %. If number % 2 == 0, it is even.

Q2. What is a prime number?
A prime number has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.

Q3. Why do we avoid checking divisibility by 1?
Because every number is divisible by 1, it gives no useful information.

Q4. Can 1 be a prime number?
No, because it has only one factor.
